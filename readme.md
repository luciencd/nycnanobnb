I'm building a nano bed and breakfast in bushwick, NYC! 

The goals are:

1. Providing an affordable housing solution to foreigners who want to experience America.

2. Providing helpful advice on where to go depending on the guest.

3. Connecting people from different countries with eachother.

4. Creating a highly efficient use of loft space for the purposes of the first three points.
